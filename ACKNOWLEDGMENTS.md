This library started as a shameless copy of [CISTA](https://github.com/felixguendling/cista). I thought "I'll just borrow a few bits" and then... well, you know how it goes.

Three rewrites and an existential crisis later, it's now something completely different. The original DNA is barely recognizable - like a ship of Theseus, but for code. Still, credit where credit is due:

- **[CISTA](https://github.com/felixguendling/cista)** - The spark that started it all. Their zero-copy serialization made me go "ooh, I want that." Then I got carried away. Very carried away.

What began as "let me just copy this serialization library" turned into POD containers, spatial indexing, robotics types, time series, and somehow quaternions. Scope creep is real, folks.

Thanks to Felix Guendling and the CISTA contributors for the inspiration. If they saw what their code evolved into, they'd probably need therapy.
