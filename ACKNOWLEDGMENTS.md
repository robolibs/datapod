This i s a shameless copy of [CISTA](https://github.com/felixguendling/cista)
Cista++ is a simple, open source (MIT license) C++17 compatible way of (de-)serializing C++ data structures.
Single header - no dependencies. No macros. No source code generation.

    Raw performance - use your native structs. Supports modification/resizing of deserialized data!
    Supports complex and cyclic data structures including cyclic references, recursive data structures, etc.
    Save 50% memory: serialize directly to the filesystem if needed, no intermediate buffer required.
    Fuzzing-checked though continuous fuzzing using LLVMs LibFuzzer.
    Comes with a serializable high-performance hash map and hash set implementation based on Google's Swiss Table.
    Reduce boilerplate code: automatic derivation of hash and equality functions.
    Built-in optional automatic data structure versioning through recursive type hashing.
    Optional check sum to prevent deserialization of corrupt data.
    Compatible with Clang, GCC, and MSVC


ITS AMAZING, please check that if you want something serious and production ready.
